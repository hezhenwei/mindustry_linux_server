# mindustry_linux_server

Steps to serve a linux mindustry server.
I just like to save the steps so next time i woun't need to re-do it again.

script in folder "webserver" will create a apache web server at port 20080
and link the folder mindustry_maps using tinyfilemanager to uploadfiles.
need to change userpass in config.php
need to change maps to 777 to allow it to write.

 tinyfilemanager is used.
